Using Node.js
	To run the website:
		'node index.js' in Command Prompt
		then go to http://localhost:5000 in Chrome
		for debugging:
			chrome tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
			Console.log statements
		'npm install' if there are problems

backend.js
	Holds our business objects
	You'll probably be working on it, as it's the easiest to work on without abstruse knowledge of our stack
	'exports' object - add functions to it to use them in index.js
	Maps are important. They're like Java HashMaps
		set (key, value)
		get (key)
		delete (key)
		has (key)

index.js
	is the "controller"
	We use Express to set up the server
		Ignore most of it
		app.get('/url', function (req, res) {
			//your callback code goes here
		});

		This callback will be run when the user goes to localhost:5000/url (or marked.io/url, etc)

		"function (req, res) {...}" is a function that takes two arguments "req" and "res"

		"res" is the main one you use, you can send a response to the user. ex, res.render
		"req" lets you see more about the user's request

EJS
	is the "view"
	activated by res.render
